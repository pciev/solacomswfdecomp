MONSTER FISHING:
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
Gigantic hermit crabs have taken 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
a liking to the graveyard of old 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
abandoned airships, using the 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
ships as their new shells and 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
homes. Reeling in one of these 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
monsters requires the strength 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
of a Robo modified with a 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
specialized fishing arm.
