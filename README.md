# solatorobo.com swf decompilation

Decompiled using [JPEXS Free Flash Decompiler](https://github.com/jindrapetrik/jpexs-decompiler)   

This is a (mostly) complete decompilation/asset rip of [solatorobo.com](https://solatorobo.org)'s Flash .swf files.
- It contains all their assets and (possibly?) complete ActionScript code.
- - It is possible that I am missing something! I'm not an expert, just trying my best.
