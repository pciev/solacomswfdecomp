# solatorobo.com swf decompilation

Decompiled using [JPEXS Free Flash Decompiler](https://github.com/jindrapetrik/jpexs-decompiler)

There may be some files missing, namely the zero-byte flv files in an swf's `movies` directory.  
  
I am working on matching the .flv files from the website archive to the swf's source .flv files.

## Files decompiled:
- [x] char.swf
- [x] ClearExternalPlaySeekMute.swf
- [x] ClearOverPlaySeekMute.swf
- [x] feat.swf
- [x] game.swf
- [x] home.swf
- [ ] multi.swf
- [ ] shep.swf
- [ ] splash-intro.swf
- [ ] splash.swf
- [ ] story.swf
