# solatorobo.com swf decompilation

Decompiled using [JPEXS Free Flash Decompiler](https://github.com/jindrapetrik/jpexs-decompiler)   

This is a (mostly) complete decompilation/asset rip of [solatorobo.com](https://solatorobo.org)'s Flash .swf files.
- It contains all their assets and (possibly?) complete ActionScript code.
- - It is possible that I am missing something! I'm not an expert, just trying my best.
   
There may be some files missing, namely the zero-byte flv files in an swf's `movies` directory.  
  
I am working on matching the .flv files from the website archive to the swf's source .flv files.

## Files decompiled:
- [x] char.swf
- [x] ClearExternalPlaySeekMute.swf
