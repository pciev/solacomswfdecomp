A mysterious child-like Felineko rescued by Red 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
while aboard the burning Hindenburg during a 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
failed mission. Traveling together with Red, this 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
blunt and reticent Felineko never willingly shares 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
much personal information. Always calm and 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
seemingly in control, Elh holds others at a 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
distance and does not get more emotionally 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
involved than necessary. Has a strong dislike 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
of bugs.
