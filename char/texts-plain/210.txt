Officially known as the "OverMephisto 9MS." 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
Using Grenâ€™s Mephisto as a base, it has been 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
personally customized by Calua himself. Based on 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
the Mephisto, it is a well-balanced fighter with a 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
Launcher for long-range attacks and a Halberd 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
for close-range. Because it's designed specifically 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
to look cool, it's not really the most efficient of 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
machines, but Calua likes it a lot.
