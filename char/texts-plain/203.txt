A member of Kurvaz's Special Operations unit 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
and Opéra's long-time subordinate. A natural 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
airhead who sometimes doesn't take things too 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
seriously. He looks up to Opéra and considers 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
Gren a valuable partner. Has the strange verbal tic 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
of qualifying everything with a "might" or a 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
"maybe." Addresses almost everyone, with the 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
exception of Opéra, as "dude," regardless of rank 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
or gender.
