Shetland is a mining island abundant in mineral deposits. The skilled inhabitants of this mining town carve out their own island to 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
mine the ore deep within to establish their industry. For mining they use modified airships which are outfitted with giant drills. For 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
regular soil they employ these special drill ships, but for harder rock they use explosives to get at the deposits, all while laying down 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
mineral transport tracks to move the debris. Because of this there are many mining holes in Shetland, and the island itself is 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
getting smaller. When the whole island is mined out the people will migrate to another mineral rich location.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
Since the whole island is one big mining field, there are giant pulleys all around the island to bring up the ore. Most of the ore 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
found here is ironstone, but once in a while a rare metal called "Glitterock" is unearthed. This ore can be sold for a very large sum 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
and is highly prized. All the miners are dream of finding a giant Glitterock one day.
