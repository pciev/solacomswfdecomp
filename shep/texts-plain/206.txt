Basset is an island born as a result of the 2nd Incantation War which took place 56 years ago. There was a battleground not too far 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
from the island, and giant ships and weapons that were destroyed in the conflict drifted along the current and eventually covered 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
the entire island. Due to this, most of the island consists of these derelict artifacts. Basset citizens collect useful parts, equipment, 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
and materials from all the abandoned ships throughout the island and export them to other cities for their livelihood. Recently, the 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
abandoned ships that form this island have degraded to such a point that much of the island is considered unstable, and unwary 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
parts scavengers have met with constant accidents.

BATTLESHIP HERMIT CRAB

Battleship hermit crabs are giant creatures that inhabit the cloudy sea around Basset. For many years people on Basset were in 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
constant conflict with these titanic crustaceans over the battleships that the crabs use as their shells, but recently a special 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
harpoon-weapon was invented to catch the monsters so that the battleships on their backs could be harvested.
