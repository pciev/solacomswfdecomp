Mau is an island where the "Oshilasama" religious faith is most practiced. This religion is only practiced by Felinekos in the remote 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
regions, and they use the power of the "nono" which exist throughout the world to cast powerful spells. Mau is particularly known 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
for its history as a training place to utilize this magic. All the citizens on this island train to wield the "nono," and once they are able 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
to use magic, they are considered full-fledged members of the religion.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
There are difficulty levels in the magic the casters can use, and to be able to use a high-level spell one must obtain the right from 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
the chief of the village. As a student of the skill continues their training, the chief will recognize their ability and will certify them 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
with a card that authorizes them to use high-level magic. These cards also contain a special design pattern to help the caster 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
control the "nono."

There is a legend that Mau’s ancestors fought vigorously against the Caninu people’s ancient ancestors, the Wolf Tribe. The upside-
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
down wolf statues on the island are said to be a magic ward that was used to seal away the Wolf Tribe’s strength during the battle.
