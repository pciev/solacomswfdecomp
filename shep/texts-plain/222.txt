The Nano-machines that collect the moisture and fragments of crystals floating around the island diffuse the sunlight, making 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
Sealyham an island shrouded in a dark atmosphere. Due to this unique eco-structure, there are a lot of fish and coal leaves that 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
only exist on this island. Additionally, when the nano-machines in the atmosphere deteriorate and start to break down, they use the 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
energy from the nearby crystals to reformat themselves. When this happens, the crystal fragments release a flake-like bubble that 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
makes it look like it’s snowing.

The flying fish indigenous to this island (Sky Fish) are nearly completely covered in the crystal shards that suffuse the atmosphere 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
and, as a result, there aren’t many parts of the animals that can be eaten. However, the small portion that is edible has a very 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
unique taste and is considered a delicacy. Due to this, the citizens of Sealyham catch the Sky Fish or farm-raise those that can be 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
for their living.
